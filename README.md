- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anvercar.

I am a .net Technical Consultant, with a solid technical background based on my more than 10 years of experience as a software developer.

I have worked on projects with .net technology, .net core, Web services, web with ASP.NET, and desktop with
Winforms and WPF.
Although as a programmer I have ended up being a fullstack developer, my professional career has been more focused on the Backend
focused more on the Backend side than on the FrontEnd side.

In these repositories you can see as a portfolio, some proofs of concept created.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in almost any topic about :

- C#
- Clean code
- Architectures
- Agile methodologies

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Blazor
